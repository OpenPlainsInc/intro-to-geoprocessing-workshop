    "# Intro to Geoprocessing with the GRASS GIS Geoprocessing Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an introduction to geoprocessing with [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org). We aim to introduce you to the basics concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how to use GRASS GIS to perform geoprocessing tasks.\n",

    "## What is GIS?  \n",
    "GIS is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations."

    "\n",
    "Geospatial data is data that is associated with a particular location on the surface of the Earth. This data can be represented in many forms, such as points, lines, polygons, and rasters. Geospatial data can be used to answer questions such as \"Where is the nearest hospital?\" or \"What is the average temperature in this region?\"."

    "\n",
    "Vector data is represented as points, lines, and polygons on a map. Points are used to represent specific locations, such as the location of a tree or a building. Lines are used to represent linear features, such as roads or rivers. Polygons are used to represent areas, such as the boundaries of a city or a forest."
